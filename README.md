# WeatherQT
A small hobby based weather app I made with the help of PyQT5 and OpenWeatherMap

## Installation
- Go to releases section and download the latest version.
- Run the setup file and do as it says
- After setup, run the executable

## Build from Source
- Download this repository as zip, and extract all files to the same folder.
- Run the command `pip install -r requirments.txt`
- In the .py file , replace the 'YOURAPIKEYHERE' with API keys from openweathermap and WAQI.
- Run the file, and it should work.
